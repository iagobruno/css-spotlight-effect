A simple spotlight effect that gives focus to a specific place on screen.

## Motivation

I want to reuse these calcs in the future.

## Future improvements

- Performance improvements in animations because some gagging occurs during transitions.
- Prevent user from interacting with another place on the screen that is not within focus point (Using [pointer-events property](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events)).
- **[See support table for the backdrop-filter property](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter)**!
